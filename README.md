# NoFilterGPT API for PHP

The NoFilterGPT API for PHP allows developers to easily integrate the power of the NoFilterGPT AI model into their PHP applications. With a simple POST request, you can generate dynamic responses from the AI, fine-tuning parameters such as temperature, token limit, and more.

## Getting Your API Key

To start using the NoFilterGPT API, you will need an API key. Simply log into your account at [nofiltergpt.com](https://nofiltergpt.com), navigate to the **"Settings"** page, click on the **"Developers"** tab, and generate your API key. It's simple and fast!

Once you have your API key, you're ready to make requests to the NoFilterGPT API and build engaging applications.

## How to Use the NoFilterGPT API

### Endpoint: `/v1/chat/completions`

The NoFilterGPT API's primary endpoint for generating AI-based chat completions is:

```
https://api.nofiltergpt.com/v1/chat/completions
```

This endpoint expects a **POST** request with the following required and optional parameters in the body, in JSON format.

### Required Parameters:

- **messages**: An array of message objects that represent the conversation. Each message object must have the following structure:
  - **role**: Either `"system"`, `"user"`, or `"assistant"`.
  - **content**: The message content. This is the text that the model will process or generate.
  
  Example:

  ```json
  "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello! Can you help me with something?"}
  ]
  ```

### Optional Parameters:

- **temperature**: Controls the creativity of the output. Lower values make the output more deterministic, while higher values increase randomness. Default: `0.7`.
- **max_tokens**: The maximum number of tokens (words/subwords) to generate. Default depends on the model.
- **top_p**: For nucleus sampling. This controls diversity by cutting off the less likely responses. Default: `1`.

### Authentication

To authenticate, you need to append your API key in the query string of the request URL like this:

```
https://api.nofiltergpt.com/v1/chat/completions?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with the actual API key obtained from your NoFilterGPT account.

## Example Usage with `example.php`

The file `example.php` in the root of this project provides a working example of how to interact with the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint using PHP.

1. **Replace the API Key**:
   Open the `example.php` file and replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual API key obtained from [nofiltergpt.com](https://nofiltergpt.com).

   ```php
   $apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
   ```

2. **Modify the Parameters** (optional):
   You can modify the request parameters, such as `messages`, `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and `top_p`, in the file to fit your specific needs. For example, you can change the user input like this:

   ```php
   'messages' => [
       ['role' => 'system', 'content' => 'You are a helpful assistant.'],
       ['role' => 'user', 'content' => 'How do I integrate this API?']
   ],
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   To execute the script and make a request to the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, simply run the PHP file on your server or local environment:

   ```bash
   php example.php
   ```

   This will output the response generated by the API based on the provided input.

### Full `example.php` Code

Here is the content of `example.php` for your reference:

```php
<?php

// CHANGE THIS VALUE HERE
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';

$url = 'https://api.nofiltergpt.com/v1/chat/completions?api_key='.$apiKey;
$data = [
    'messages' => [
        ['role' => 'system', 'content' => 'You are a helpful assistant.'],
        ['role' => 'user', 'content' => 'Hello! Can you help me with something?']
    ],
    'temperature' => 0.7,
    'max_tokens' => 150,
    'top_p' => 1
];

$options = [
    'http' => [
        'header' => "Content-Type: application/json
",
        'method' => 'POST',
        'content' => json_encode($data),
    ]
];

$context = stream_context_create($options);
$response = file_get_contents($url, false, $context);

if ($response === FALSE) {
    die('Error');
}

echo $response;

?>
```

### Handling Responses

The API response will include a generated completion (i.e., a response from the assistant) and any additional data. Handle error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
